            Thanks for your interest in knowing more about what I do beyond
            coding. I’m a multi-passionate creator who loves to explore,
            experiment, and learn from every experience. Some of my hobbies have
            even turned into monetized ventures, and I’m excited to expand
            further. <br /><b>Scroll down to discover my passions beyond coding!</b>
